My First Tome
===========

A simple MtG flavor text game. You are given the flavor text and must guess the card name.

(Lofty) Goals
---
- [ ] Create difficulty settings which limit the card pool
- [ ] Accept lowercase responses, and those with a few characters off
- [ ] Add a counter to track progress and performance
- [ ] Improve the look and feel
- [ ] Allow users to guess from other card values (ie. Oracle text, collector number and set, etc.)
- [ ] Accept 'part marks' for knowing the card's block/set, mana cost, types, etc.
